# My First Decentralized Application 

This is my first ever Decentralized Application created by me with the help of extensive documentation and the help of video tutorials. 

This is a simple tutorial where users can set their mood and get their mood anytime on the expense of Ethers on Goerli Test Network. 

To run this Decentralized Application, 

1. Clone this Repository. 
2. Cd into the folder and open terminal. 
3. Configure node js lite-server and call for it. 



To run this application, you should have at least one digital wallet which supports Goerli TestNet. 


This repository is open to contribution by fellow developers - Blockchain Developers. You can build this much more and more features. Do clone this repository and start working on this and contribute openly.
